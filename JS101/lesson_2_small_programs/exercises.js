// Q1
// logs 10
// myFunc() resasigns num from 5 to 10 and is called before the console log

// Q2
// myFunc() logs 5 when called and reassigns num to 10
// console.log(num) logs 10 because it was reassined in the function

// Q3
// myFunc() is new declaration/initialization of num not a reassignment
// console.log(num) logs 5

// Q4
// Reference error, console is trying to log num = 10 but it decalred after

// Q5
// not argumnt added to function so it won't run
// logs 5

// Q6
// logs 3, while loop executes when num = 3

// Q7
